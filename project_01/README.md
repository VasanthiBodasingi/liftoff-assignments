# Capstone Project Plan

Restaurant Menu and online ordering


## Overview
My project will be a website/forum that will allow users to create a profile; edit and display their lego collections; create, edit, and display their unique Lego creations(MOCs); and view the collections and MOCs of other users.

I am planning to build an application for a restaurant.
The application will be used to display the restaurant menu in detail and place online orders
Users can

2.search the menu
3.view each item (ingredients and calories)
4.customize their order
4.place online order
